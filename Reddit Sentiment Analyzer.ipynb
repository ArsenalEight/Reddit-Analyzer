      "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread March 2023\n",
      "I am 26, so I have several decades until retirement. My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much. I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued. My last review in one of these was [Dec 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6bdjt/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/hn1ot2t/). Since then, I have made some adjustments, mostly by researching new companies and updating what I focus on when doing my analysis. I am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades (that surely won't be the case, but I'm okay with that; not all of these will be good investments, but most of them should, I think).\n",
      "\n",
      "My goal is not doing 50% in a year or buying low and selling high. My goal is to outperform the index modestly, at maybe 2-3% annually, which would compound very nicely over decades. I'm okay with the risk that I underperform at a modest rate. I want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment.\n",

      "-\tA wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.\n",
      "-\tHigh margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.\n",
      "-\tSustainable buybacks and dividend growth.\n",
